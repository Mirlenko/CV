Hello!

I am Aleksandr Mirlenko, Automation Project Engineer at [`ABB`](https://global.abb/group/en).

Let me briefly tell you my story. I was studying at [`Saint Petersbrug State University 'LETI'`](https://etu.ru/en/university/) at the `Faculty of Electrical Engineering` and Automatics, and my major was `Control in Technical Systems`. After graduation from the Bachelor's degree in June, 2015 (btw, my bachelor's thesis topic was `'Battery Cyclization Automatic System'`), I applied for Double Degree program between 'LETI' and [`Lappeenranta University of Technology 'LUT'`](https://www.lut.fi/web/en/) in Finland. My first year at master's was in 'LETI', and the second year, as well as the diploma thesis, took place in Lappeenranta, Finland. In January, 2017, I started to work on my master's thesis; the topic was [`Control of electrically excited synchronous motor in the field weakening range`](link). After graduation from both Universities in August, 2017, I found a job at my home city, in the [`System-Service`](http://systserv.spb.ru/), at the Department of `Gas Compressing Units` automation. I was working with mainly [GAZPROM](https://www.gazprom.com/) Compressing Stations, and even conducted Startup and Commissioning beyond the Arctic Circle, at [Zapolyarnoe Gas Field](https://www.gazprom.com/projects/zapolyarnoye/).
