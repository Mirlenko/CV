# Short information about me

Hello!

I am Aleksandr Mirlenko, Automation Project Engineer at [`ABB`](https://global.abb/group/en).

Let me briefly tell you my story. I was studying at [`Saint Petersbrug State University 'LETI'`](https://etu.ru/en/university/) at the `Faculty of Electrical Engineering` and Automatics, and my major was `Control in Technical Systems`. After graduation from the Bachelor's degree in June, 2015 (btw, my bachelor's thesis topic was [`Battery Cyclization Automatic System`](https://github.com/Mirlenko/CV/tree/main/papers)), I applied for Double Degree program between 'LETI' and [`Lappeenranta University of Technology 'LUT'`](https://www.lut.fi/web/en/) in Finland. My first year at master's was in 'LETI', and the second year, as well as the diploma thesis, took place in Lappeenranta, Finland. In January, 2017, I started to work on my master's thesis; the topic was [`Control of electrically excited synchronous motor in the field weakening range`](https://github.com/Mirlenko/CV/tree/main/thesis). After graduation from both Universities in August, 2017, I found a job at my home city, Saint Petersburg, in the [`System-Service`](http://systserv.spb.ru/), at the Department of `Gas Compressing Units` automation. I was working with mainly [`Gazprom`](https://www.gazprom.com/) Compressing Stations, and even conducted Startup and Commissioning beyond the Arctic Circle, at [Zapolyarnoe Gas Field](https://www.gazprom.com/projects/zapolyarnoye/). However, as I was dreaming about employment at `ABB` (my master's thesis Professor Olli Pyrh√∂nen had influenced my view on this company), I took a challenge and applied for Automation Project Engineer position at newly opened [Operation Center](https://new.abb.com/cz/en/about/technology-and-innovation/operation-center-europe) office in Kaliningrad. The project I am proud most is [`Global 1 Cruise Ship`](https://www.mv-werften.com/en/ships/global.html); I developed `Vessel Management System` control software for it. Within the Company, I also worked on projects for Data Center in Modiin, Israel, Pulp & Paper plant in Spain etc.
Programming always seemed to me as the most interesting part of my job. The `Industry 4.0` concept inspired me to dive deeper into automation; the [Generations](https://new.abb.com/marine/generations) magazine gave me a development direction - in April, 2020 I started to learn Data Science. I started my data science journey with `Python` and its data-oriented frameworks (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn`). When I got confident with data manipulation in Python, I refreshed my knowledge of Statystics, and the stats packages (`scipy`, `statsmodels`), mastered Machine Learning theory and practiced it using `scikit-learn`. After that, I went deeper for Deep Learning theory and practice (`tensorflow`, `keras`). I also studied `Microsoft Azure` Data Scince services, `SQL` on DB2 IBM Cloud, `Apache Spark`.
Now, I consider myself as a `Digitalization Specialist`, and looking forward to apply the recently gained knowledge and skills in real-time projects.

If you are interested in cooperation with me, please contact me by email [`mirlenko.al@gmail.com`](mailto:mirlenko.al@gmail.com).

Please take a look at the projects, that I implemented during my Digital Technologies studies:
## Industry 4.0:
### Regression: [Propulsion Plants Maintenance Prediction](https://github.com/Mirlenko/Propulsion_Plants_Maintenance_Prediction)
### Computer Vision: [Surface Defects Classification](https://github.com/Mirlenko/Surface_Defects_Classification)

## Other:
### Unsupervised Learning (Clustering): [Foursquare Data Clustering](https://github.com/Mirlenko/Foursquare-Data-Clustering)
### Supervised Learning (Regression): [Churn Rate Prediction](https://github.com/Mirlenko/Churn-Rate-Prediction)
### Natural Language Processing (NLP): [Ig Nobel Prize Paper Titles Generation](https://github.com/Mirlenko/Ig_Nobel_Prize_Paper_Titles_Generation)
